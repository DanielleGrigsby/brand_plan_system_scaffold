> “A structured system for organizing brand strategy, visual assets, and design implementation.”

## 🔗 Notion Brand Plan Template

Use the Notion template here:  
👉 [Brand Plan Template – Notion](https://creativeprojects.notion.site/Brand-Plan-Template-20dd36b0a4848027bc6eefd685f8dcbd)

**Note:**  
The brand matrices (Logotypes, Color, Typography, Design Elements) are already installed and configured in the Notion template.  
This system is a **developing work in process** — modular, adaptable, and continuously improving.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project turns a strategic brand plan into a functional, scalable system.  
It serves as a practical toolset for teams that need to manage creative consistency across websites, printed media, digital platforms, and organizational workflows.

## 🧰 What's Inside

### 1. 📁 `design_brand_plan_assets/` — Visual Asset Framework

This is a structured, scalable folder system for organizing real creative outputs, ready for use across design, development, and documentation workflows.

Includes export-ready asset folders:

- **Colors** → `design_brand_plan_assets_color/`
- **Typography** → `design_brand_plan_assets_typography/`
- **Design Elements** → `design_brand_plan_assets_elements/`
- **Logotypes** → `design_brand_plan_assets_logos/`

The structure is optimized for versioning, clarity, and handoff across platforms like Webflow, Figma, Notion, or GitHub. Each folder reflects semantic categories that match the Brand Plan's logic — but operates as a real-world production layer.

### 2. 📐 Brand Plan Template + Strategy Docs

- **`Brand_Plan_Template_Notion Page.md`**  
  This is the master outline that scaffolds the entire brand system. It's designed to be used in Notion or adapted to other documentation platforms.

The Brand Plan includes **four main sections**:

#### 1. Brand Discovery / Excavation
- Clarifies the brand’s name, goals, audience, offer, value proposition, and core identity.
- Explores differentiation, SWOT, and competitive position.

#### 2. Brand Direction / Building
- Defines personality, archetype, tone, and visual identity cues.
- Includes mission, vision, values, and positioning.

#### 3. Brand Messaging / Amplification
- Develops themes, essence, elevator pitch, messaging pillars, and story.
- Helps guide marketing, web copy, and campaign strategy.

#### 4. Brand Design / Visual Identity
- Maps out logotypes, color palette, typography system, and design elements.
- Built to align with Webflow, Figma, and web-based design workflows.

### 3. 📊 Visual Identity Matrices

Structured `.csv` and Notion-compatible databases for scalable visual decisions:

- `Brand Logotypes Combination Matrix`
- `Brand Color Matrix`
- `Brand Typography Matrix`
- `Brand Design Elements Matrix`

Each matrix supports filtering, asset creation, and strategy alignment. Designed to plug into Notion, Airtable, or spreadsheet-based tools for visual documentation and planning.
